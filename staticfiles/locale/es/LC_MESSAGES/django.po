"come up with product descriptions, translate them into several languages and "
"monitor the relevance of the information - the booster will do exactly what "

"have free space in the raid just for You. They do a raid not for You, but "
"for the sake of someone else, and regardless of whether You buy this raid or "
"not, they will go to this raid, but with Your order You will be a nice bonus "
"for this boosters team, as a result, this team will most likely offer the "

"After you have chosen the service You are interested in, trading begins for "

"specified price. If the price offered by the booster is not the lowest, the "
"booster sees it in his personal account and can offer a new price for the "

"the customer during the formation of the order, the bidding for the order is "
"terminated. The customer sees all the available offers from different "
"boosters and can select the offer he needs and pay for it. Also, the "
"customer does not have wait for the completion of the bidding for the order "
"and select the offer he needs during the bidding process. For example, the "
"bidding time was 30 minutes, but after 5 minutes of bidding, an offer was "
